# Tidy
Music and audio widget.


I love listening to music while working. Now I also know what I'm listening to.

The widget shows the "Now Playing" using the Windows API, so it works regardless of the player.

Color it as you like and place it wherever you want.

Drag with the mouse or with the arrow keys. Hold Shift for precise movement.

### FAQ
* Can I control playback from the widget? Working on it.
